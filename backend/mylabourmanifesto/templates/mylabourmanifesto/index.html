            <ul>
                <li>We will measure our economic success not by the number of billionaires, but by the ability of our people to live richer lives.</li>
                <li>A Labour government will guarantee no rises in income tax for those earning below £80,000 a year, and no increases in personal National Insurance Contributions or the rate of VAT</li>
                <li>Under Labour’s plans, 95 per cent of taxpayers will be guaranteed no increase in their income tax contributions</li>
                <li>Our Fiscal Credibility Rule is based on the simple principle that government should not be borrowing for day-to- day spending, but that future growth depends on investment</li>
                <li>In London, to ensure our capital continues to prosper, we will build Crossrail 2</li>

            <h2>Negotiating Brexit</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Labour accepts the referendum result and a Labour government will put the national interest first.</li>
                <li>We will end Theresa May’s reckless approach to Brexit, and seek to unite the country around a Brexit deal that works for every community in Britain.</li>
                <li>We will introduce legislation to ensure there are no gaps in national security and criminal justice arrangements as a result of Brexit.</li>
